Limitless - main layout preview
Main layout includes a full set of elements, components, extensions, custom pages, widgets, charts and layout options. Child layouts are shells and include only layout related pages, but support all available components from the main layout. SCSS files are well structured so that you can easily find necessary one, whether it's a component or layout.
